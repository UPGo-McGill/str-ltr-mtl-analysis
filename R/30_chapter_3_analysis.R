# STR-induced housing loss ------------------------------------------------

#' At the end of 2019, there were 5,150 [1] FREH listings in the City of 
#' Montreal, and 370 [2] more housing units which were operating as ghost 
#' hostels. In total, therefore, short-term rentals removed 5,520 [3] housing 
#' units from Montreal’s long-term market last year (Figure 3.1). Notably, while 
#' the number of active daily listings declined by 5.5% over 2019, the number of 
#' housing units which STRs took off of Montreal’s housing market increased by 
#' 16.5% [4] in that same time period, from 4,740 [5] to 5,520.

#' dedicated STRs, while the figure is 2.2% [2] for Le Plateau-Mont-Royal. In

#' 1.5% [3] in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal in 2018 (CMHC did not release a number for

# The impact of STRs on rental housing supply and vacancy rates -----------

#' In 2019, the City of Montreal’s rental vacancy rate declined for the third 
#' year in a row, reaching a 15-year low of 1.6% [1]. According to CMHC, a 
#' healthy rental market should have a vacancy rate of at least 3%, but most 
#' neighbourhoods in the central city are significantly below that. Le Sud-Ouest 
#' had the city’s lowest vacancy rate, at 0.3% [2], which means that, of the 
#' zone’s approximately 31,000 [3] rental apartments, fewer than 100 [4] were 
#' available to be rented by prospective tenants in October 2019, when CMHC’s 
#' survey was conducted. In general, vacancy rates are even lower for 
#' family-sized housing units (defined by CMHC as units with two or more 
#' bedrooms). For example, the vacancy rate for units with three or more 
#' bedrooms was 0.5% [5] for Ville-Marie (the Downtown Montreal/Îles-des-Soeurs 
#' zone), and 0.3% [6] in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal.

#' For example, in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce/Côte-St-Luc zone, 66.9% [1] of 
#' households are renters, so we assume that 66.9% of housing units converted to 
#' dedicated STRs would have been rental housing, and the remaining 33.1% would 
#' have been ownership housing.

# The impact of STRs on residential rents ---------------------------------

#' Between 2015 and 2019, we estimate that STRs have been responsible for a 
#' 2.4% [1] increase in the average monthly rent. As average rents have risen 
#' 16.9% [2] in this time period, this implies that one seventh of all rent 
#' increases over the last five years have been caused by the growth of STRs. 
#' Put differently, from 2015 to 2019, the average renter household in Montreal 
#' has paid an additional $870 [3] in rent because of the impact of STRs on the 
#' housing market.
