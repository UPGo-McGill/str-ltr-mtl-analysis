# Active daily listings ---------------------------------------------------

#'  In 2019 there was an average of 9,040 [1] active daily listings (Figure 2.1) 
#'  operated by an average of 5,330 [2] hosts. These hosts collectively earned 
#'  $224.6 million [3] in 2019—an average of $24,800 [4] per daily active 
#'  listing or $42,100 [5] per active host. There was also a daily average of 
#'  12,480 [1] listings which were visible on the Airbnb and VRBO websites but 
#'  were blocked by the host from receiving reservations. The presence of these 
#'  listings can erroneously suggest that a city’s STR market is larger than it 
#'  is; in the case of Montreal, blocked listings outnumber listings which are 
#'  actually active. When these blocked but inactive listings are included, the 
#'  average listing earned $9,500 [6] last year, and the average host earned 
#'  $16,900 [7]. Finally, there was a daily average of 240 [8] listings that 
#'  were not located in private housing units (B&Bs, hotels, etc.), which 
#'  have been excluded from the analysis in this report. 
#'  
#'  Active daily listings peaked in August 2018 [9] at 11,840 [9], and have 
#'  since declined. There were 5.5% [10] fewer listings active on average in 
#'  2019 than in 2018. However, host revenue followed the opposite pattern, 
#'  increasing by 14.9% [10] between 2018 and 2019. These facts point to an 
#'  increasingly commercializing STR market, where the number of listings is 
#'  relatively stable but a rising proportion of these listings are operated on 
#'  a full-time basis.

# STR growth rates --------------------------------------------------------

#' Overall, the year-over-year change in average active listings from 2016 to 
#' 2017 (12 months) was 18.6% [1], the year-over-year change from 2017 to 2018 
#' was 0.9% [2], and the year-over-year change from 2018 to 2019 was -5.5% [3]. 
#' In the first half of 2020, active listings fell much faster thanks to the 
#' COVID-19 pandemic. The year-over-year change in active daily listings for 
#' 2020 so far (January to July) is -25.2% [4].
#' 
#' Despite there being fewer active listings in 2019 than in 2018, the number of 
#' reserved nights increased by 12.3% [5], from 1.70 million [6] reserved nights 
#' to 1.91 million [6] reserved nights, while revenue increased 14.9% [7]. In 
#' fact, with a few brief exceptions, revenue maintained a positive 
#' year-over-year growth rate consistently until the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
#' (Revenue from January to July 2020 is down 55.8% [8] compared to the same 
#' time last year).

# Montreal in comparison with other major Canadian cities -----------------

#' falling in both cases behind Toronto (Table 2.2). However, in relative terms 
#' Vancouver stands considerably ahead of both Montreal and Toronto. Vancouver 
#' had the most active listings per 1000 households (12.3 [3] compared to

#' STR activity in Montreal is highly concentrated in the central-city boroughs 
#' of Ville-Marie and Le Plateau-Mont-Royal (Table 2.2). These two boroughs 
#' accounted for 32.6% [1] and 25.9% [1] of all listings in 2019 respectively, 
#' and even higher shares of host revenue (41.2% [1] and 29.6% [1]). The borough 
#' with the next highest percentage of average number of daily active listings 
#' is Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie (8.0% [2]), followed by Le Sud-Ouest (7.0% [2]). 
#' Each accounts for around 6% [2] of annual STR revenue in the city.
#' 
#' Ville-Marie and Le Plateau-Mont-Royal have by far the most STR activity when 
#' measured in per-capita terms. In Ville-Marie, active STR listings account for 
#' 4.8% [1] of all the borough’s housing units, while the equivalent figure for

#' of numerous host accounts which we discuss below) earned $12.8 million [2] 
#' (Table 2.5). Throughout the City of Montreal, there were 38 hosts [3] that 
#' earned more than $500,000 in 2019. Figure 2.6 shows the percentage of the 
#' total $222.7 million in STR revenue which accrued to each decile of hosts. 
#' The most successful 10% of hosts earned more than two-thirds (68.8% [4]) of 
#' all STR revenue. The revenue concentration is even steeper among the top 10%: 
#' the top 5% earned 58.9% [5] of revenue, while the top 1% of hosts earned
